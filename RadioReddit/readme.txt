========ABOUT========

radioreddit.com is the source for quality new and popular independent music. 
Our live streams are not controlled by program directors and DJs in the pockets 
of large labels. Songs are chosen by an algorithm which only weighs users' votes 
when deciding what gets played and what gets excluded as junk. Songs with high 
voter approval eventually make it onto the radio reddit charts and get promoted
by having a higher probability of being played. radio reddit was created by
musicians who wanted a place where all music was given a fair chance to be 
heard. Where pay-for-play, label preference, and underhand deals were done 
away with. Where listeners were in control."
